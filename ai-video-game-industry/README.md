# AI Video Game Industry Project

This project explores the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the video game industry, focusing on its usage, opinions surrounding it, and the layoffs that have occurred from 2022 to 2025. The project is structured to provide insights through interactive tabs that allow users to navigate between different years of layoff data.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains CSV files with layoff data for the years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025.
  - `2022-layoffs.csv`: Layoff data for the year 2022.
  - `2023-layoffs.csv`: Layoff data for the year 2023.
  - `2024-layoffs.csv`: Layoff data for the year 2024.
  - `2025-layoffs.csv`: Layoff data for the year 2025.
Also contains pdf with survey data from the GDC 2024 State Of The Game Industry report.
  - `sdc_survey.pdf`: Report data from 2024

- **images/**: Contains images used in the project.
  - `ai_banner2_Pixabay.png`: A banner image used at
  the top of the page.

- **videogameai.html**: The main HTML document that structures the layout of the webpage. It includes:
  - Inline styles for the project.
  - Embedded JavaScript for loading CSV data, managing tab functionality, and updating content dynamically.
  - Sections for AI usage, opinions on AI, and layoffs.
